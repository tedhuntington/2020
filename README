Welcome to 2020!

Installing
==========
1) get 2020.tar.gz from web http://www.geocities.com/ted_huntington
2) tar -xvzf 2020.tar.gz
3) cd 2020
4) make
[Please use the most recent gcc, I had no problems with 3.2]
(note:  if you get a seg fault when running 2020, try "make less".
With an older version of gcc there can be a problem with the "floodfill" function
using recursion that uses more stack space than available. This will use a different
flood fill, and the pictures may not look complete but you can still play the game.)
5) make install
6) 2020

Enjoy!
